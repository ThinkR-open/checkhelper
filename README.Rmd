# checkhelper
A package to help you deal with devtools::check outputs

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  fig.path = "man/figures/README-",
  out.width = "100%"
)
```

## Examples

Check the package and get the globals missing

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Get globals
globals <- get_no_visible()
globals

# Print globals to copy-paste
print_globals(globals)
# Store in package using usethis::use_r("globals")
```
